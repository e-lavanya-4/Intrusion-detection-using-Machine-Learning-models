# Intrusion-detection-using-Machine-Learning-models
The project aims to establish a comparative result on the efficiency of different machine learning models for intrusion detection.
The aim of the project is to build a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections called intrusions or attacks and good connections or normal connections.
Network intrusion is any unauthorized activity on a computer network. Intrusion Detection Systems can be classified into three types:
1. Network Intrusion Detection System
2. Network Node Intrusion Detection System
3. Host Intrusion Detection System
The project is based on Host Intrusion Detection system using packet transfer information.
This project focuses on four Machine Learning models â€“ Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors. Since training of models require clean and meaningful data, we first preprocess then data and then only implement the models. The final step is to compare the models based on various aspects and select the most feasible model.
